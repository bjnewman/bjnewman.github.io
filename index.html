  <p>Luckily, there are a lot of brave, kind and smart people in the world working to help</p>
  <nav> Here are some good places to look for more information:
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="https://www.unicef.org">UNICEF</a> </li>
      <li> <a href="https://www.unhcr.org"> The UN Refugee Agency</a></li>
      <li> <a href="https://worldreliefchicago.org">World Relief</a> is one of the few national organizations that  partners with the US State Department to resettle refugees here </li>
      <li> <a href="https://www.msf.org">Doctors Without Borders</a> are often working in extremely dangerous conditions to bring necessary medical care to vulnerable populations</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Or to find out more about this project click <a href="about.html">here</a>

  <p>If we examine the homepage for Doctors Without Borders there are many noticeable features that make the page easy to navigate. The buttons to donate or volunteer are pinned to the top of the screen, and the links to social media are prominently displayed and pinned both to the left and bottom of the screen. Some might consider this design to be intrusive but for a non-profit the number of homepage visits likely does not drive as many donations as social campaigns. The most recognizable HTML elements are lists of links (which include relative links and global addresses).</p>
